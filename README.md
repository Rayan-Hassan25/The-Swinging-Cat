# 🐱 Swinging Cat Animation

A fun and simple animation project built in Visual code Studio using HTML, CSS, and a short JavaScript script.
The project features a cat hanging from a rope, swinging smoothly against a pink background.


## 🎨 Features

-Animated Cat:The cat drops down from the top and starts swinging gently.
-Dynamic Rope: A white rope connects perfectly to the cat, moving with the swing.
-Vibrant Background:Soft pink background for a playful and aesthetic look.
-Lightweight Code:Built with clean, minimal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
-Browser Compatible:Works smoothly on all modern browsers.

 🧩 Technologies Used

-HTML5– structure of the page and image placement
-CSS3– styling, colors, and animation effects
-JavaScript (short script)– to trigger the rope drop and swinging motion
-VCStudio – development environment used to design and preview the project

 ⚙️ How It Works

1. The HTML sets up the **rope** and **cat image** elements.
2. CSS handles the **positioning**, **background color**, and **animation keyframes** for swinging.
3. A short JavaScript snippet initializes the drop, then transitions into a **swinging motion** using CSS animation or transform updates.

 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the project in **VCStudio** (or any code editor).
3. Run the `index.html` file in your browser.
4. Watch the cat drop and start swinging from the rope!
